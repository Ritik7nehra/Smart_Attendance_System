# Smart Attendance System using Face Detection with Open CV

## Software Engineering project
# Introduction

The Smart Attendance System will automatically mark attendance by detecting and recognizing faces using a camera. This will eliminate manual attendance marking, making the process efficient and less prone to errors.

Hardware: A computer with a webcam.
Software : Python, OpenCV, NumPy, dlib (for face detection), face_recognition (for face recognition), SQLite or any other database (for storing attendance records)

# Instructions to run: 

i)First download or clone the project

ii)Import the project to your favourit IDE

iii)Create an python enviroment

iv)Install all the packages

v)Change the mail information

vi)Run the project using the command line or your IDE Run Button

# Testing and Debugging : 
i)Ensure the face registration works correctly.

ii)Test the recognition system with multiple faces.

iii)Debug any issues related to face detection and recognition accuracy.
